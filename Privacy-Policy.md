# LISA Privacy Policy

## Statement

* We are providing this explanation about our information practices as a show of our commitment to protect our users' privacy because we respect our users' privacy of information.

* This privacy policy describes the types of information that may be collected from you or may be provided by you when using LISA or servers where LISA is present and our practices for collection, use, maintenance, protection and disclosure of that information.

* Kindly read this privacy policy very carefully in order to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we treat it.

* If you don't agree with our policies and practices, it's your choice of not using our bot.

* By adding LISA to your Discord server, you agree that you have read our privacy policy and terms of service and agree to the same.

## Storage Of Data

* The following data is only stored, when the bot joins a Discord server and the certain modules are used. The server ID is still stored in our database in order to setup our databse for the bot's prefix in a particular Discord server, which is customizable and essential for us in order to ensure that the bot is able to work in a Discord Server.

* Server IDs for server data which include:
  1. Prefixes
  2. Settings
  3. Antinuke
  4. Ignore
  5. Vcrole
  6. Media-Only Channel
  7. Autorole
  8. Welcome

* User IDs to keep a record of:
  1. Mute
  2. Afk

* Our bot only gathers personally identifiable data through the commands run using the bot. This information helps us in providing a better user experience for all LISA's users.

* Information collected by us when you vote for LISA on the third-party Discord bot listing website (Top.gg):
  1. Your Username
  2. Your User ID
  3. Date and Time, when the votes are done.

* This information is stored by us on MongoDB private cluster and is deleted as soon as the bot is kicked for a Discord server.

#### Note: All of the information stored is very sensitive keeping in mind every user's privacy, so we ensure our best in keeping all of the information secured.

## Data Access:

The data which is stored by us is only accessible to the Bot Developers and none other than them.

## How Can You Get Rid Of The Data Stored?

* As mentinoned earlier, server IDs are stored in our database and that the database for a server is deleted when the bot is kicked from a server.

* So honestly, we cannot delete your server ID from our database, since we require your server ID in order to ensure that the bot is not used for purposes which are against Discord's Terms of Services, etc.

## Data Security:

* We take steps to ensure that the data provided from LISA is protected from misuse, loss, alteration, or unauthorized access.

* However, no internet-based system can be declared fully secure and error free, which is a common sense, but do note that, we put all of our effort in the security of our users' data, etc.
