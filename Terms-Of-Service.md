## Restrictions on your use of Resystance's services:

Resystance allows you to send messages in Discord channels without being able to clearly determine the person responsible for each message. Therefore, the owner of a Discord server is liable for any messages or actions taken by the bot.

Following are the actions which are not allowed to be performed by you:

* Send advertisements of any kind using Resystance's message system.

* Make the server from which a direct message was sent unrecognizable.

* Resystance always includes the server from which a direct message was sent in order to ensure that users can keep track of the servers from which the messages are being sent to them. Thus, you must ensure that every direct message you send using Resystance is clearly identifiable as a message from your server.

* Repeatedly send messages in a short time span, especially not via direct messages.

* Using Resystance in servers that violate Discord's Community Guidelines or the use of Resystance in such a manner that contravenes them.

* Tricking, defrauding, or misleading us and other users, especially in any attempt to learn sensitive account information such as user passwords, etc.

* Improper use of our support services or submission of false reports of abuse or misconduct.

* Engagement in unauthorized framing of or linking to the website.

* Attempt to bypass any measures of the Bot which are designed to prevent or restrict access to the Bot or any portion of the Bot.

* Use of any type of unauthorized automation within Discord.

#### Note: 

* Breaking any of the mentioned terms of services will lead us to blacklist you and ban you from using our services.
